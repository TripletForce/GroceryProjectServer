Receipt Project Server

There are two solutions. The example connection tests functionality for debuggin pourposes. The ReceiptServer solution starts at Program.

The program class connects to the database, creates a list of http routes for the client to call, and then sends those events of to the HttpServer class handle the requests. 

The PurchasedItems and Receipts class are the same as the client's verion and is used for a serialized connection between the client and server.

Open the ReceiptServer.sln to open the application.
